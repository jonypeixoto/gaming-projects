## :information_source: How to Use

## Here, you will find the step by step to run this project
</br><br/><br/>
** Attention ** It is necessary to create your database in the hosting and then import it to your hosting as the following tutorial shows: [on HostGator, a server that I use](https://suporte.hostgator.com.br/hc/pt-br/articles/115000385293-Como-criar-um-banco-de-dados-no-cPanel-)
<br/><br/></br>
In this project, follow the commands on prompt command: 

<br/>
1- Don't forget to download XAMPP and activate the servers: Apache and MySQL so that access to:

<br/>

https://localhost

<br/>

1.2- Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) inside your project folder using the documentation and your command prompt.

<br/>

2- It is important that you insert the DB.sql file in your PHPMyAdmin server for the correct reading of your database synchronously with the project files.

<br/>

3- I recommend hiring an email marketing service to configure the "Email.php" file according to the SMTP server or have a more accessible SMTP service, some options are:

<br/>

[SMTP Service - Gmail](https://kinsta.com/en/blog/smtp-servidor-gmail/)

<br/>

You can test HostGator's SMTP service (I already used it to test this web application)
<br/>

[HostGator SMTP](https://www.hostgator.com.br/blog/o-que-e-protocolo-smtp/)

<br/>

4- If you want to insert your application online, follow these steps:
<br/>
Hosting (along with the server) must have already been purchased to follow this step:

<br/>
<br/>

![](https://github.com/jonypeixoto/jonypeixoto/blob/main/assets/serverconfiguration.png)

<br/>
<br/>

4.1- Go to the HOME of your CPanel, then in MySQL Databases, choose a name for your database and click on "Create Database".
<br/>

4.2- Then, in CPanel, go to PhpMyAdmin, click in the left corner on your database and click "Import", click "execute" and that's it, your database downloaded here from GitHub.
<br/>

4.3- Finally, just transfer your files to the server (for example, you can use [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or directly in your CPanel)
<br/>
The steps below are for [Project15-4-Dynamic-Site-advanced-and-control-panel-advancedPHP-and-news-portal-and-management](https://github.com/jonypeixoto/full-stack-web2-projects/tree/main/full-stack-web-projects/Project15-4-Dynamic-Site-Advanced-and-Control-Panel-AdvancedPHP-and-News-Portal-and-Management)
<br/>
<br/>
However, before uploading the application (in this specific case, go to the "config.php" files). Then fill in the DOMAIN, HOST NAME, USER ACCESS, PASSWORD AND DATABASE NAME.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Lastly, create a user and give user permission in the MySQL Databases of your CPanel and don't forget to add your user to your previously created database. Also, so that there is no error in "login.php"
<br/>

Choose SOLUTION 1 or SOLUTION 2 below so that there is no problem logging into the panel:

SOLUTION 1:
<br/>
Change the following code in "index.php":
<br/>
header('Location: '.INCLUDE_PATH_PANEL);
die();
<br/>
for
<br/>
Panel::redirect(INCLUDE_PATH_PANEL);
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
![](https://github.com/jonypeixoto/jonypeixoto/blob/main/assets/serverconfiguration4.png)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SOLUTION 2:
<br/>
Or also change the following code in "login.php":
<br/>
Insert the start and end functions according to the print below:

<br/>
<br/>
